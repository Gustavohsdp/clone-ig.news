          React was introduced in May 2013. Its paradigm shift was that your UI was a function of <br>
          your state. Given some component state, React can determine what your component will <br>
          look like. React is built upon the idea of state. However, state has long been one of the <br>
          most difficult parts of building a React application.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          Let's imagine state management in React as a rugged tool belt. You've used this tool belt<br>
          for years, slowly adding new tools as needed. Each tool serves a very specific purpose. You<br>
          don't use your hammer to screw in bolts. As a craftsman, you've learned the right time and<br>
          place to use each tool.
        </p>
        <p class="p3">
          State management with React is a rugged tool belt, but not everyone has the prior <br>
          experience to know which tool to reach for. This post will explain the past, present, and <br>
          future of state management to help you make the correct decision for your team, project, or<br>
          organization.

            Before we begin, it's critical you understand some of the terms commonly used. These <br>
            aren't the canonical names. A few different variations of each float around, but the <br>
            underlying ideas are the same:<br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              UI State – State used for controlling interactive parts of our application (e.g. dark mode <br>
              toggle, modals).
            </li>
            <li>
              Server Cache State – State from the server, which we cache on the client-side for quick <br>
              access (e.g. call an API, store the result, use it in multiple places).
            </li>
            <li>
              Form State – The many different states of a form (e.g. loading, submitting, disabled, <br>
              validation, retrying). There's also controlled & uncontrolled form state.
            </li>
            <li>
              URL State – State managed by the browser (e.g. filter products, saving to query <br>
              parameters, and refreshing the page to see the same products filtered)
            </li>
            <li>
              State Machine – An explicit model of your state over time (e.g. a stoplight goes from<br>
              green → yellow → red, but never green → red).
            </li>
          </ul>
