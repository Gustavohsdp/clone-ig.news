          React was introduced in May 2013. Its paradigm shift was that your UI was a function of <br>
          your state. Given some component state, React can determine what your component will <br>
          look like. React is built upon the idea of state. However, state has long been one of the <br>
          most difficult parts of building a React application.<br>

          for years, slowly adding new tools as needed. Each tool serves a very specific purpose. You<br>
